## TwitchBot

A bot created specifically for my Twitch channel Shawtygoldq. It implements all the functions I need at the moment.

## Project Functionalities

- **Commands**: This functionality allows the app to respond to commands given by viewers in chat. You can customize the name of the commands and how to respond to them; You can use variables in the command: {user}, {channel}, {random_chatter}, {random(a,b)}.
- **Timers**: This functionality allows the application to display a message in chat at a certain interval. You can customize the name of the timers and the message that will be sent after the timer is triggered, as well as the message interval between timers; ;
- **Timeout**: Sending a chat participant to think about his/her behavior when bad words appear in the chat room;
