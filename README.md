## TwitchBot

A bot created specifically for my Twitch channel Shawtygoldq. It implements all the functions I need at the moment.

## Project Functionalities

- **Commands**: This feature allows the app to respond to commands given by viewers in the chat. You can customize the name of the commands and the way they are answered; You can use variables in the command: {user}, {channel}, {random_chatter}, {random(a,b)};
- **Timers**: This feature allows the app to display a message in the chat after a certain amount of time. You can customize the name of the timers and the message that will be sent after the timer fires, as well as the message interval between the timers;
- **Timeout**: Sending a chat participant to think about their behavior when bad words appear in the chat;
